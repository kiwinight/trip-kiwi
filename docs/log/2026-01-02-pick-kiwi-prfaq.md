## Pick Kiwi Launches: Your Personal Shopping Assistant

### The AI-powered service that finds what to buy for you — so you can stop searching and start buying

**Seoul, South Korea — January 2, 2026** — Today, Pick Kiwi officially launches to help overwhelmed shoppers escape the trap of endless searching and decision fatigue. Think of it as having a personal assistant who finds exactly what you should buy — searching the web, reading Reddit threads, comparing options — and delivers a complete report you can act on immediately.

### The Problem

Modern shoppers don't struggle because of a lack of information — they struggle because of too much of it. The average consumer spends hours researching a single purchase, reading reviews, comparing options, and ultimately asking themselves: _"Is this really okay to buy?"_

This uncertainty leads to:

- Endless searching across dozens of tabs
- Decision paralysis that delays purchases for days or weeks
- Buying something and immediately regretting it
- Or abandoning the purchase entirely

The paradox of choice has made shopping exhausting.

### The Solution

Pick Kiwi eliminates this friction entirely. Users describe what they're looking for — like asking a personal assistant "Hey, I need a birthday gift for my wife, can you find something good?" — and Pick Kiwi finds the answer. The result is a layered report: a quick recommendation at the top, a comparison of top options, and detailed reasoning you can dig into if needed.

"We built Pick Kiwi because we realized people don't want to do the work of finding what to buy — they want someone to find it for them," said [Founder Name], founder of Pick Kiwi. "Every recommendation engine makes you do more work. We do the opposite. We're your personal shopping assistant."

### How It Works

1. **Tell us what you need** — "Birthday gift for my wife, she likes practical things, budget $100"
2. **We find what to buy** — searching the web, reading Reddit threads, comparing options
3. **Get your report** — a layered report with our top pick, comparison table, and full reasoning

Read as much as you need: just the recommendation, or dive into the details.

"I spent three weeks trying to pick a coffee machine. I asked Pick Kiwi and got a full report in 2 minutes — with Reddit opinions, price comparisons, and a clear recommendation. Bought it that night." — [Early User Name], early access user

### Availability

Pick Kiwi is available now at [pickkiwi.com]. Bring your own OpenAI API key and get unlimited reports — free.

## External FAQ (Customer Questions)

### Q: What is Pick Kiwi?

**A:** Pick Kiwi is your personal shopping assistant. Tell us what you're looking for, and we find what to buy — searching the web, reading Reddit threads, comparing options. You get a complete report with our top recommendation, a comparison table, and detailed reasoning. Think of it as delegating your shopping to a thorough personal assistant who finds the answer for you.

---

### Q: How does it work?

**A:**

1. **Tell us what you need** — describe your situation naturally:
   - "Birthday gift for my wife, she's practical, budget $100"
   - "Need wireless headphones for commuting, under $200"
   - "Looking for a coffee machine, I'm a beginner"
2. **We find what to buy** — Pick Kiwi searches the web, reads Reddit threads, compares options, and compiles everything into a report
3. **Get your report** — a layered report you can read as much as you need:
   - **Quick Pick**: TL;DR recommendation at the top
   - **Comparison Table**: Top 3-5 options side by side
   - **Full Reasoning**: Why we picked this, what Reddit says, what to watch out for

The whole process takes 2-3 minutes. You get what would take you hours to find.

---

### Q: What can I use Pick Kiwi for?

**A:** Pick Kiwi is launching with a focus on **gift shopping** — the category where decision fatigue hits hardest.

**v1 Focus: Gifts**

- Birthday presents
- Holiday gifts
- Thank-you gifts
- Anniversary presents
- Gifts for people you don't know well

**Coming soon:**

- Electronics (phones, laptops, headphones)
- Home & household items
- Personal purchases

We're starting narrow to get really good at one thing before expanding.

---

### Q: Is it free?

**A:** Yes — Pick Kiwi is free to use. You just need to bring your own OpenAI or Anthropic API key (BYOK model).

**How it works:**

- You provide your own API key (we include a simple setup guide)
- You pay OpenAI/Anthropic directly for usage (~$0.05-0.20 per report)
- No limits on reports — use as much as you want

**Why BYOK?**

- Keeps the service free for everyone
- You control your own costs
- No subscription or credit purchases needed

**Coming soon:** For users who don't want to set up an API key, we'll add a credit purchase option.

---

### Q: What if I don't like the recommendation?

**A:** Every report includes a comparison table with multiple options — you're not locked into our top pick. You can also see exactly why we recommended what we did.

If you want different results, you can refine your criteria and get a new report. Sometimes a small change (like adjusting budget or specifying a preference) leads to completely different recommendations.

---

### Q: How is this different from just asking ChatGPT?

**A:** Four key differences:

1. **Thoroughness by default**: Pick Kiwi always delivers a complete report — comparison table, Reddit opinions, pros/cons, where to buy. ChatGPT gives you whatever it thinks of first.

2. **Real-time web search**: Pick Kiwi searches the web and Reddit for current information. ChatGPT relies on training data that may be outdated.

3. **Structured output**: ChatGPT's answers vary every time. Pick Kiwi always returns the same layered report format — quick pick at top, details below. You can read as much as you need.

4. **No prompt engineering**: ChatGPT requires you to ask the right questions. Pick Kiwi guides you through what it needs to know, like a good assistant would.

The difference isn't intelligence — it's finding what to buy for you, every time.

---

## Internal FAQ (Stakeholder Questions)

### Q: Why now?

**A:** Two converging factors:

1. **Decision fatigue at all-time high**: E-commerce has exploded options. The average consumer faces 10x more choices than a decade ago. Existing tools (more reviews, more comparisons) make the problem worse, not better.

2. **Gap in the market**: ChatGPT can answer shopping questions, but it's a general-purpose tool. There's no purpose-built product that takes "I need to buy X" and returns a structured, confident decision with real community insights.

---

### Q: Who is the target user?

**A:** Primary persona for v1:

**"The Overwhelmed Researcher"**

- 25-45 years old
- College-educated professional
- US-based (English-speaking)
- Behavior: Researches purchases thoroughly, opens 15+ tabs, reads reviews for hours, then either delays the purchase or buys and second-guesses

They don't lack information — they lack confidence to stop searching.

**Key insight:** For gift shopping, the questions must focus on the **recipient**, not the shopper:

- Who is this gift for? (colleague, family, friend, partner)
- What's their personality? (practical, playful, luxurious, sentimental)
- What's the occasion? (birthday, thank you, holiday, just because)
- What do they already have too much of?

**User Interview Insights:**

**Quote 1: The Tired Traveler**

> "I'm in Taiwan and exhausted from all the sightseeing... My sister loves perfume and I want to get her something unique — a local Taiwanese brand. But I don't speak Chinese, and I'm too tired to research on my laptop. I just want to find something quickly. **I wish someone would just do the research for me!**"

_Insight: Physical exhaustion + language barrier + gift pressure = strong need for delegation_

**Quote 2: The Generational Gap**

> "My cousin's birthday is coming up. She's 12 years younger than me — what do girls her age even like these days? I want to give her something she'd actually enjoy. Or maybe something she couldn't afford herself? Something memorable? **Ugh, researching this is such a hassle.**"

_Insight: Age gap creates uncertainty about preferences. Wants something meaningful but doesn't know where to start._

**Quote 3: The Busy Boyfriend**

> "My girlfriend's birthday is coming up... What should I get her this year? Last year was an Apple Watch, year before was an iPad... What now? Another Apple product feels so boring. **Are there any good options out there? I'm so busy with work — I wish someone would just find something for me.**"

_Insight: Repeat gift-giving creates "idea fatigue." Busy schedule means no time to explore options._

**Common Themes:**

- "I wish someone would do the research for me" — all 3
- Too tired/busy to search — Quote 1, 3
- Don't know what's good for recipient — Quote 2, 3
- Want something unique/memorable — Quote 1, 2

### Q: What's the competitive landscape?

**A:**

| Competitor                    | What They Do                               | Why We're Different                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini** | General Q&A, can answer shopping questions | No structured output, requires prompt skill, inconsistent format |
| **Amazon Rufus**              | Conversational shopping within Amazon      | Locked to Amazon inventory only, optimized for Amazon's goals    |
| **Perplexity Shopping**       | Research + "Buy with Pro" feature          | General-purpose, not structured for decisions                    |
| **Wirecutter**                | Curated "best of" lists                    | Static content, not personalized to your situation               |
| **Google Shopping**           | Price comparison, aggregated reviews       | More information, not less — worsens decision fatigue            |
| **Honey / Rakuten**           | Deal finding, cashback                     | Assumes you already know what to buy                             |

**Our wedge**: None of these say "here's the one thing you should buy, given your specific situation." They all add options; we remove them. Plus, we search Reddit for real community opinions.

### Q: What are the top 3 risks?

**A:**

| Risk                                                                  | Likelihood | Impact                 | Mitigation                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AI tools (ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini) add structured shopping features** | High       | Critical — existential | Move fast; build brand trust; Reddit integration as differentiator; focus on UX depth they won't prioritize                  |
| **LLM gives bad recommendation**                                      | Medium     | High — destroys trust  | Start with well-understood categories; show reasoning transparently; collect feedback aggressively; use Reddit as validation |
| **Users don't trust AI to decide for them**                           | Medium     | High — low adoption    | Frame as "assistant" not "decider"; always show reasoning; include backup option                                             |

**Biggest unknown**: Will users actually delegate purchase decisions to an AI? Early interviews suggest yes for low-to-medium stakes purchases (gifts, household items). High-stakes (cars, homes) likely no.

**On competing with big AI tools**: Our advantage isn't the AI — it's the structured UX, Reddit community research, and focused decision output. Big platforms optimize for engagement; we optimize for ending the shopping process.

### Q: What's the business model?

**A:** Phased approach:

**v1: BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)**

- Users provide their own OpenAI or Anthropic API key
- Zero cost to us — users pay their own API costs
- Includes easy step-by-step guide for API key setup
- Focus: Validate product-market fit before monetizing

**v2: Credits + Affiliate (Future)**

- Add credit purchase option for users without API keys
- Low price point: ~$0.25-0.50 per report
- Affiliate revenue as secondary income stream
- Works through affiliate networks (Amazon Associates, ShareASale, etc.)

**v3: B2B / White-label (Future)**

- "Pick Kiwi for Corporate Gifting"
- "Pick Kiwi for Employee Onboarding Purchases"
- Enterprise API access

**Why BYOK first?**

- Ship faster without payment integration
- Attract tech-savvy early adopters who give better feedback
- Validate the product before optimizing revenue

### Q: How do we measure success?

**A:**

**Primary metrics:**

| Metric              | Definition                                                                                                                                          | Target (Month 3) |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Completion rate** | % of users who start a session AND receive a final decision card (excludes users who quit mid-flow)                                                 | >70%             |
| **Purchase intent** | % who report they purchased or plan to purchase the recommendation (via follow-up survey or feedback)                                               | >30%             |
| **Return rate**     | % of users who come back within 7 days to make another decision — measures trust in first pick                                                      | >15%             |
| **NPS**             | Net Promoter Score: "How likely are you to recommend Pick Kiwi?" (0-10). Score = (% of 9-10) - (% of 0-6). Above 40 is good, above 70 is excellent. | >40              |

**Note on product links:** Providing direct purchase links is optional — users can search for the recommended product themselves. If we include affiliate links, we can track click-through rate, but it's not our primary success metric.

**Secondary metrics:**

- Time to decision (target: <2 minutes)
- Feedback submission rate
- Social shares / screenshots

**Anti-metric:**

- We do NOT optimize for "decisions per user" — more decisions isn't better. We optimize for confident decisions that lead to purchases.

### Q: What does Year 1 success look like?

**A:**

**By end of Year 1:**

- 50,000 reports generated
- 10,000 monthly active users
- Gift category mastered with high satisfaction
- Clear signal on willingness to pay (via v2 credits launch)
- Affiliate revenue generating (secondary)

**Qualitative success:**

- Users say "Pick Kiwi saved me hours"
- Word-of-mouth growth visible
- Clear differentiation from "just ask ChatGPT"

---

### Q: What could kill this project?

**A:**

1. **OpenAI/Google ships this feature natively**

   - If ChatGPT adds a "Shopping Mode" with structured output, we lose our primary differentiator
   - Mitigation: Build brand, community, and UX depth they won't match

2. **LLMs plateau in reliability**

   - If recommendation quality doesn't improve, users won't trust us
   - Mitigation: Human review layer, narrow categories, transparent reasoning

3. **Users prefer the research process**

   - Some people enjoy researching — it's retail therapy
   - Mitigation: Focus on users who explicitly hate the process

4. **BYOK limits mainstream adoption**
   - Only tech-savvy users have API keys; may miss target market
   - Mitigation: Add credit option in v2; keep BYOK as power-user option

---

### Q: How will we acquire early users?

**A:**

**Constraints:**

- Solo founder with full-time job
- Limited time for content creation
- Budget: ~$50/day ($1,500/month)

**Strategy: Paid acquisition first, organic later**

| Channel                           | Budget/Day | Why                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Meta Ads (Instagram/Facebook)** | $25        | Target "gift ideas", "shopping help" interests. Low time investment once set up.                 |
| **Reddit Ads**                    | $25        | Highly targeted communities: r/GiftIdeas, r/BuyItForLife, r/Frugal. Our users are already there. |

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Validate demand**

- Landing page with waitlist
- Run $50/day ads to test messaging
- Goal: 500 signups, <$3 per signup

**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): Early access**

- Invite waitlist users in batches
- Collect feedback aggressively
- Refine based on real usage

**Phase 3 (Month 3+): Scale what works**

- Double down on winning ad creative
- Add organic content if time permits
- Consider influencer seeding for gift season

**Why not content marketing?**

- Takes too much time for a solo founder with a day job
- Paid ads give faster feedback loops
- Can add organic later once product-market fit is clear
