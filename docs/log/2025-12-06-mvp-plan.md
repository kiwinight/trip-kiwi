# Trip Kiwi MVP Plan

## Goal

Build a minimal 2-panel web app where users can chat with an AI to create and modify travel itineraries in real-time.

## Core Concept

A "Cursor for Travel Planning" - conversation on one side, live-updating itinerary document on the other.

---

## MVP Scope

### In Scope

- 2-panel layout (Chat + Plan Editor)
- AI-powered itinerary generation and modification
- Real-time plan updates as user converses
- Local storage persistence (no auth)
- Single trip at a time

### Out of Scope (Future)

- Resources panel (saved places, restaurants, hotels)
- Version control for itineraries
- User authentication
- Multi-trip management
- Collaboration features
- Mobile optimization

---

## Tech Stack

- pnpm (monorepo with `/web` directory)
- React Router 7
- Material UI v7
- OpenAI API or Claude API
- React state + localStorage

---

## UI Structure

```
+---------------------------+------------------+
|                           |                  |
|      Plan Editor          |      Chat        |
|      (Itinerary)          |      Panel       |
|                           |                  |
|  - Trip title/dates       |  - Message list  |
|  - Day-by-day schedule    |  - Input box     |
|  - Activities with times  |                  |
|                           |                  |
+---------------------------+------------------+
```

### Plan Editor (Left Panel)

- Display trip metadata (destination, dates, title)
- Day-by-day breakdown
- Each day shows: activities, times, locations, notes
- Visual indication when AI is updating

### Chat Panel (Right Panel)

- Message history (user + AI)
- Text input with send button
- Loading state during AI response
- System message for context

---

## User Flow

1. User lands on homepage
2. Starts new trip by entering destination and dates (simple modal/form)
3. AI generates initial itinerary suggestion
4. User refines through conversation:
   - "Add a museum on Day 2"
   - "Make the schedule more relaxed"
   - "Swap Day 3 and Day 4"
5. Plan updates in real-time on left panel
6. Trip auto-saves to localStorage

---

## Success Criteria

MVP is complete when:

- [ ] User can start a new trip (destination + dates)
- [ ] User can chat with AI about their trip
- [ ] AI generates and modifies itinerary based on conversation
- [ ] Plan Editor updates in real-time
- [ ] Trip persists in localStorage across refreshes
