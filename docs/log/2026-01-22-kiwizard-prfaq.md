## Kiwizard Launches: Your AI Playground for Personality Tests, Fortune Telling, and Fun

### The web app that turns AI into entertainment — discover yourself through playful conversations

**Seoul, South Korea — January 22, 2026** — Today, Kiwizard officially launches as the go-to destination for AI-powered personality tests, fortune telling, and interactive chatbot experiences. Think of it as a playground where each activity is a conversation — you chat, you discover, you share.

### The Problem

AI has become incredibly capable, but most AI experiences feel like work. ChatGPT is powerful but sterile. Existing personality test websites are static, outdated, and feel like filling out forms from 2010.

Meanwhile, there's a massive appetite for self-discovery:

- MBTI has become a cultural phenomenon — people put their type in dating profiles
- 사주 (fortune telling) apps top Korean app store charts
- Character.ai proved people want to chat with AI personalities

But these experiences are fragmented. You go to one site for MBTI, another app for fortune telling, another for chatbots. Each has different UX, different quality, no social layer.

### The Solution

Kiwizard brings all of this together in one beautifully designed playground. Browse activities like scrolling Netflix. Each activity is an AI-powered conversation — not a boring form. Get results as shareable "Artifacts" — visual cards you can post to your feed or save for later.

"We built Kiwizard because we realized AI should be fun, not just useful," said Alex Kwon, founder of Kiwizard. "Every personality test site feels stuck in 2015. We're building what those sites would look like if they were designed today, with AI at the core."

### How It Works

1. **Browse activities** — Explore a grid of AI experiences: MBTI, fortune telling, compatibility tests, character chatbots, and more
2. **Chat to discover** — Each activity is a conversation. The AI asks questions naturally, not through boring forms
3. **Get your Artifact** — When complete, you receive a visual result card — your "Artifact"
4. **Share on Feed** — Post your Artifacts to the community feed, see what others discovered

"I've taken MBTI tests on every website. Kiwizard's version actually felt like a conversation — like talking to a friend who happens to be a psychologist. And the result card was so pretty I had to share it." — [Early User Name], beta tester

### Availability

Kiwizard launches first on web at [kiwizard.app], with iOS and Android apps coming soon. Free to use — bring your own API key for unlimited sessions, or purchase credits if you prefer.

## External FAQ (Customer Questions)

### Q: What is Kiwizard?

**A:** Kiwizard is a web app where you can enjoy AI-powered activities — personality tests, fortune telling, compatibility quizzes, and character chatbots. Each activity is a conversation with an AI agent designed specifically for that experience. When you complete an activity, you get an "Artifact" — a visual result you can save or share.

Think of it as a playground of AI experiences, all in one place.

---

### Q: How does it work?

**A:**

1. **Browse** — Open Kiwizard and see a grid of activities (MBTI, 사주, ideal type finder, etc.)
2. **Select** — Click an activity that interests you
3. **Chat** — Have a conversation with the AI. It asks questions naturally — no boring forms
4. **Get your Artifact** — When the activity completes, you receive a visual result card
5. **Share (optional)** — Post your Artifact to the community feed or keep it private

You can have multiple chat sessions per activity, switch between them, and revisit past results anytime.

---

### Q: What activities are available?

**A:** Kiwizard is launching with:

**v1 (Launch):**

- MBTI 성격 검사 — Conversational personality typing
- 사주 / 일일운세 — Fortune telling and daily horoscope

**Coming soon:**

- 에니어그램 — Enneagram personality test
- 정치 성향 테스트 — Political compass
- 이상형 찾기 — Ideal type finder
- 공감 능력 테스트 — Empathy assessment
- 나만의 브랜드 찾기 — Personal brand discovery
- 너와 나의 성격 합은? — Compatibility checker
- 캐릭터 챗봇 — Chat with AI characters

We're starting focused to get the experience right, then expanding based on what users want.

---

### Q: Is it free?

**A:** Yes — Kiwizard is free to start, no signup or payment required.

**How it works:**

1. **Try free first** — Your first 1-2 activities are completely free. We cover the AI cost so you can experience Kiwizard with zero friction.

2. **When free runs out** — After your free activities, you'll see two options:

| Option | Cost | Best for |
|--------|------|----------|
| **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** | Free forever (you pay your LLM provider directly, ~$0.01-0.05 per session) | Power users, unlimited usage |
| **Credits** | ~$1 for 20 sessions | Casual users who don't want to set up API keys |

**Why this model?**

- No friction for first-timers — just click and play
- BYOK keeps it free for tech-savvy users
- Credits are cheap for everyone else
- We don't show ads or sell your data

---

### Q: How is this different from just asking ChatGPT?

**A:** Four key differences:

1. **Purpose-built experiences** — Each activity is designed specifically for that test or experience. ChatGPT gives generic responses; Kiwizard's MBTI agent is built to type you accurately through conversation.

2. **Beautiful Artifacts** — You get a visual result card, not a wall of text. Designed to be saved and shared.

3. **Session management** — Switch between chat sessions, revisit past results, see your history. ChatGPT conversations get lost in endless threads.

4. **Social layer** — Share your results to a community feed. See what others discovered. ChatGPT is a solo experience.

ChatGPT is a general-purpose tool. Kiwizard is entertainment designed around self-discovery.

---

### Q: Can I share my results?

**A:** Yes! Every Artifact can be:

- **Saved** — Stored in your activity history
- **Shared to Feed** — Posted to Kiwizard's community feed
- **Downloaded** — Saved as an image to share anywhere

The Feed shows recent posts from the community. You can also view your own profile to see all your shared Artifacts.

---

### Q: What languages are supported?

**A:** Kiwizard launches with support for both Korean and English. The AI understands and responds in both languages naturally.

Future plans include auto-translation for Feed content, so you can discover interesting results from users worldwide.

---

### Q: Do I need an account?

**A:** No — you can use Kiwizard without an account.

- **Without account**: Sessions and Artifacts are saved locally in your browser
- **With account**: Sync across devices, share to Feed, build your profile

We recommend creating an account if you want to share results or access your history from multiple devices.

---

### Q: Is there a mobile app?

**A:** Kiwizard launches first as a web app, accessible from any browser on any device. Native iOS and Android apps are coming soon after web launch.

The mobile apps will have full feature parity with the web version, plus:

- Push notifications for daily fortune
- Better sharing to Instagram/TikTok
- Offline access to saved Artifacts

## Internal FAQ (Stakeholder Questions)

### Q: Why now?

**A:** Three converging trends:

1. **AI is ready** — LLMs can now hold natural conversations that feel human. Personality tests no longer need to be static forms.

2. **심리테스트 culture is mainstream** — MBTI types are in dating profiles, 사주 apps top charts, compatibility tests go viral on social media. Self-discovery content has massive demand.

3. **Existing solutions are outdated** — 16personalities.com looks like it was built in 2012. Fortune telling apps feel cheap. Character.ai proved the format works but lacks polish. There's room for a beautifully designed, unified experience.

The timing is perfect: the technology is ready, the demand is proven, and the competition is weak.

---

### Q: Who is the target user?

**A:** Primary persona for v1:

**"The Self-Discovery Seeker"**

- 18-35 years old
- Active on social media (Instagram, TikTok, Twitter)
- Has taken MBTI before, probably multiple times
- Enjoys personality content (BuzzFeed quizzes, zodiac memes, MBTI compatibility charts)
- Korean or English speaking

**Behavioral traits:**

- Takes tests for fun, not just accuracy
- Shares results with friends
- Returns when new activities launch
- Values aesthetic presentation (won't share ugly result cards)

**Secondary personas:**

- **Fortune enthusiasts** — Regular 사주/운세 consumers looking for AI-powered versions
- **Chatbot users** — Character.ai users who want cleaner UX and more variety

---

### Q: What's the competitive landscape?

**A:**

| Competitor | What They Do | Why We're Different |
|------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **16personalities.com** | MBTI test | Static forms, dated UI, no AI conversation |
| **Character.ai** | AI character chat | General chatbots, no structured tests/results, cluttered UX |
| **사주/운세 apps** | Fortune telling | Single-purpose, often ad-heavy, no social layer |
| **BuzzFeed quizzes** | Personality quizzes | Static content, no AI, declining quality |
| **ChatGPT / Claude** | General AI chat | Not purpose-built, no artifacts, no social sharing |

**Our wedge:** We're the platform that combines:
- AI-powered conversational tests (not forms)
- Beautiful, shareable Artifacts
- Multiple activity types in one place
- Social feed for discovery

---

### Q: What are the top 3 risks?

**A:**

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **AI quality inconsistent** — MBTI typing or fortune results feel wrong/generic | Medium | High — destroys trust | Extensive prompt engineering, user feedback loops, start with well-defined activities |
| **Low retention** — Users try once and don't return | High | High — no growth | Regular new activities, daily fortune feature, social engagement hooks |
| **Platform competition** — ChatGPT adds "personality test mode" | Medium | Critical — existential | Move fast, build brand/community, focus on UX depth and social features they won't prioritize |

**Biggest unknown:** Will users share Artifacts publicly? The social layer depends on users being willing to post results. Early testing needed.

---

### Q: What's the business model?

**A:** Phased approach:

**v1: Free Trial → BYOK or Credits**

| Stage | What happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **Free trial** | First 1-2 activities completely free (we cover LLM costs) |
| **Limit reached** | User is blocked from further interaction |
| **Conversion prompt** | Two options presented: BYOK (free forever) or Buy Credits |

| Revenue stream | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **BYOK** | Users bring their own API key — free for us, ~$0.01-0.05 per session for them |
| **Credits** | Purchase credits (~$1 for 20 sessions) — margin on top of API costs |

**Why this model:**

- Zero friction to try — no signup, no payment, no API key setup
- Users experience the product before any conversion ask
- BYOK users cost us nothing and become power users
- Credit purchases fund the free trial pool

**v2: Premium Activities (Future)**

- Some activities could be premium-only
- Early access to new activities
- Subscription tier for unlimited access

**v3: B2B / White-label (Future)**

- "Kiwizard for Team Building" — corporate personality assessments
- API access for other apps to embed activities

**Key principle:** No ads, no data selling. Revenue comes from users who find value.

### Q: How do we measure success?

**A:**

**Primary metrics:**

| Metric | Definition | Target (Month 3) |
|--------|------------|------------------|
| **Completion rate** | % of users who start an activity AND receive an Artifact | >60% |
| **Conversion rate** | % of users who hit limit AND choose BYOK or Credits | >20% |
| **Share rate** | % of Artifacts that get shared to Feed | >15% |
| **Return rate** | % of users who come back within 7 days | >25% |
| **NPS** | Net Promoter Score | >40 |

**Secondary metrics:**

- Sessions per user per week
- Time spent in chat (engagement)
- Activities tried per user
- Feed scroll depth

**Anti-metric:**

- We do NOT optimize for "sessions per user" alone — quality matters more than quantity

---

### Q: What does Year 1 success look like?

**A:**

**By end of Year 1:**

- 100,000 total users (web + mobile combined)
- 20,000 monthly active users
- 10+ activities live
- iOS and Android apps launched
- Active community feed with daily posts
- Clear signal on willingness to pay (via credit purchases)
- Word-of-mouth growth visible

**Qualitative success:**

- Users say "Kiwizard is the best place to take personality tests"
- Artifacts get shared on Instagram/Twitter organically
- Community forms around comparing results
- Mobile app ratings 4.5+ stars

---

### Q: What's the platform strategy?

**A:**

**Phase 1: Web first**

- Launch on web (React, responsive design)
- Works on mobile browsers from day one
- Faster to build, easier to iterate
- No app store approval delays

**Phase 2: Native mobile apps**

- iOS and Android using React Native
- Shared codebase with web where possible
- Timeline: 2-3 months after web launch
- Key mobile features: push notifications, native sharing, offline support

**Why web first:**

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Speed | Ship faster, get feedback faster |
| Iteration | Update instantly without app store reviews |
| SEO | Personality tests are highly searchable — "MBTI test" gets millions of searches |
| Sharing | Web links are easier to share than app deep links |
| Cost | One codebase initially, expand to native later |

**Tech stack:**

- Web: React (current codebase)
- Mobile: React Native (code sharing potential)
- Backend: Same API serves both platforms

---

### Q: What could kill this project?

**A:**

1. **AI quality doesn't meet expectations**
   - If MBTI results feel random, or fortune telling feels generic, users won't trust it
   - Mitigation: Heavy investment in prompt engineering, start narrow (2 activities), iterate based on feedback

2. **No social traction**
   - If users don't share to Feed, the social layer dies
   - Mitigation: Make Artifacts beautiful and shareable, add incentives for sharing, consider private-by-default option

3. **OpenAI/Google ships this feature**
   - If ChatGPT adds a dedicated "personality tests" mode with shareable results
   - Mitigation: Move fast, build brand, focus on community/social features they won't build

4. **User fatigue with AI**
   - If AI hype dies down and people stop caring
   - Mitigation: Focus on entertainment value, not "AI" as the selling point

---

### Q: How will we acquire early users?

**A:**

**Constraints:**

- Solo founder with limited time
- Budget: ~$50/day ($1,500/month)

**Strategy: Content + Paid acquisition**

| Channel | Budget/Day | Why |
|---------|------------|-----|
| **TikTok/Instagram Reels** | Organic | Short videos showing Artifact results, "I got INFJ" reactions |
| **Reddit** | $25 | Target r/mbti, r/enneagram, r/astrology communities |
| **Meta Ads** | $25 | Target personality test interest groups |

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Seed users**

- Launch with MBTI + 사주
- Post results on personal social media
- Reach out to MBTI/personality content creators
- Goal: 1,000 users, understand what resonates

**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): Paid validation**

- Run $50/day ads testing different activities/angles
- A/B test: "AI personality test" vs "Chat-based MBTI" vs "Share your type"
- Goal: <$2 per user, identify winning creative

**Phase 3 (Month 3+): Scale what works**

- Double down on winning channels
- Launch new activities to drive return visits
- Leverage Feed content for organic growth
