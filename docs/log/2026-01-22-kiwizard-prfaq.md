## Kiwizard Launches: Your Playground for Personality Tests, Fortune Telling, and Games

### Chat in. Have fun. Share out.

**Seoul, South Korea — January 22, 2026** — Today, Kiwizard officially launches as the go-to destination for personality tests, fortune telling, and interactive games — all through AI companions. Think of it as a playground where each companion brings a unique experience — you chat, you have fun, you share.

### The Problem

Personality tests, fortune telling, and games are hugely popular — but they're limited by their format.

**Existing experiences are static:**

- **Fixed questions only** — 16personalities asks the same 60 questions to everyone. No follow-ups, no flexibility.
- **No context** — You can't explain "Well, it depends on the situation..." Everything is multiple choice.
- **Same for everyone** — Every user gets identical questions in identical order. No personalization.
- **Predictable games** — Games follow scripted paths. No improvisation, no surprises.

**What if you could just... talk?**

Chat unlocks what static forms can't:

- Ask follow-up questions based on your answers
- Gather rich context through natural conversation
- Adapt to each person differently
- Create dynamic, unpredictable experiences

That's why we built Kiwizard.

### The Solution

Kiwizard brings personality tests, fortune telling, and games to life through AI companions.

Instead of clicking through forms, you chat with a companion. Each companion asks follow-up questions, adapts to your answers, and creates a personalized experience. Every conversation feels unique and engaging.

When you're done, you get a beautiful "Artifact" — a visual result card you can save or share to the community feed.

"We built Kiwizard because these experiences should feel personal and engaging, not like filling out forms," said Alex Kwon, founder of Kiwizard. "AI companions bring warmth and personality to personality tests, fortune telling, and games — making them fun and meaningful."

### How It Works

1. **Browse companions** — Explore AI companions for MBTI, fortune telling, compatibility tests, mystery games, and more
2. **Chat** — Have a natural conversation with your companion. No boring forms, just engaging dialogue
3. **Get your Artifact** — When complete, you receive a beautiful visual result card — your "Artifact"
4. **Share on Feed** — Post your Artifacts to the community feed, see what others discovered

"I've taken MBTI tests on every website. Kiwizard's companion actually felt like talking to a friend who happens to be a psychologist. The conversation was engaging, and the result card was so beautiful I had to share it." — [Early User Name], beta tester

### Availability

Kiwizard launches first on web at [kiwizard.app], with iOS and Android apps coming soon. Free to use — bring your own API key for unlimited sessions, or purchase credits if you prefer.

---

### Q: Is it free?

**A:** Yes — Kiwizard is free to start, no signup or payment required.

**How it works:**

1. **Try free first** — Your first 1-2 companions are completely free. We cover the cost so you can try Kiwizard with zero friction.

2. **When free runs out** — After your free companions, you'll see two options:

| Option                        | Cost                                                                       | Best for                                       |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** | Free forever (you pay your LLM provider directly, ~$0.01-0.05 per session) | Power users, unlimited usage                   |
| **Credits**                   | ~$1 for 20 sessions                                                        | Casual users who don't want to set up API keys |

**Why this model?**

- No friction for first-timers — just start chatting
- BYOK keeps it free for tech-savvy users
- Credits are cheap for everyone else
- We don't show ads or sell your data

### Q: How is this different from just asking ChatGPT?

**A:** Five key differences:

1. **Purpose-built companions** — Each companion is designed specifically for that test or game, with personality and expertise. ChatGPT gives generic responses; Kiwizard's MBTI companion knows exactly what questions to ask and how to adapt based on your answers.

2. **Structured yet flexible** — ChatGPT is too open-ended. Kiwizard companions guide the conversation with personality while staying flexible enough to ask follow-ups and gather context.

3. **Beautiful Artifacts** — You get a visual result card, not a wall of text. Designed to be saved and shared.

4. **Session management** — Switch between chat sessions, revisit past results, see your history. ChatGPT conversations get lost in endless threads.

5. **Social layer** — Share your results to a community feed. See what others are exploring. ChatGPT is a solo experience.

ChatGPT is a general-purpose tool. Kiwizard offers engaging companions that make personality tests, fortune telling, and games feel personal and fun.

---

### Q: Can I share my results?

**A:** Yes! Every Artifact can be:

- **Saved** — Stored in your history
- **Shared to Feed** — Posted to Kiwizard's community feed
- **Downloaded** — Saved as an image to share anywhere

The Feed shows recent posts from the community. You can also view your own profile to see all your shared Artifacts.

---

### Q: What languages are supported?

**A:** Kiwizard launches with support for both Korean and English. Companions understand and respond in both languages naturally.

Future plans include auto-translation for Feed content, so you can discover interesting results from users worldwide.

---

### Q: Do I need an account?

**A:** No — you can use Kiwizard without an account.

- **Without account**: Sessions and Artifacts are saved locally in your browser
- **With account**: Sync across devices, share to Feed, build your profile

We recommend creating an account if you want to share results or access your history from multiple devices.

---

### Q: Is there a mobile app?

**A:** Kiwizard launches first as a web app, accessible from any browser on any device. Native iOS and Android apps are coming soon after web launch.

The mobile apps will have full feature parity with the web version, plus:

- Push notifications for daily fortune
- Better sharing to Instagram/TikTok
- Offline access to saved Artifacts

## Internal FAQ (Stakeholder Questions)

### Q: Why now?

**A:** Three converging trends:

1. **Chat enables what forms can't** — Conversational interfaces can now ask follow-up questions, gather context, and personalize experiences. This wasn't possible (or affordable) before.

2. **심리테스트 culture is mainstream** — MBTI types are in dating profiles, 사주 apps top charts, compatibility tests go viral. This content has massive demand.

3. **Existing solutions are stuck with static forms** — 16personalities.com still uses the same 60 questions for everyone. Fortune telling apps are rigid. There's room for flexible, conversational experiences.

The timing is perfect: the technology enables personalization, the demand is proven, and the competition is stuck in the past.

---

### Q: Who is the target user?

**A:** Primary persona for v1:

**"The Self-Discovery Seeker"**

- 18-35 years old
- Active on social media (Instagram, TikTok, Twitter)
- Has taken MBTI before, probably multiple times
- Enjoys personality content (BuzzFeed quizzes, zodiac memes, MBTI compatibility charts)
- Korean or English speaking

**Behavioral traits:**

- Takes tests for fun, not just accuracy
- Shares results with friends
- Returns when new companions launch
- Values aesthetic presentation (won't share ugly result cards)
- Enjoys personality and emotional connection in digital experiences

**Secondary personas:**

- **Fortune enthusiasts** — Regular 사주/운세 consumers looking for more engaging, conversational fortune telling
- **Game lovers** — Players who enjoy interactive mystery games and casual experiences
- **AI companion seekers** — People who enjoy chatting with AI personalities and want more than generic assistants

---

### Q: What's the competitive landscape?

**A:**

| Competitor              | What They Do        | Why We're Different                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **16personalities.com** | MBTI test           | Fixed 60 questions, no follow-ups, no personalization |
| **Character.ai**        | Character chat      | General chatbots, no structured results, cluttered UX |
| **사주/운세 apps**      | Fortune telling     | Static readings, no conversation, ad-heavy            |
| **BuzzFeed quizzes**    | Personality quizzes | Multiple choice only, no flexibility                  |
| **ChatGPT / Claude**    | General chat        | Too open-ended, no structure, no artifacts, no social |
| **ChatMystery**         | Detective games     | Complex setup, niche audience, no social sharing      |

**Our wedge:** We combine:

- AI companions with personality and warmth (not generic chatbots)
- Conversational flexibility (follow-ups, context, personalization)
- Purpose-built for specific experiences (MBTI, fortune, games)
- Beautiful, shareable Artifacts
- Social feed for discovery

---

### Q: What are the top 3 risks?

**A:**

| Risk                                                                             | Likelihood | Impact                               | Mitigation                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Companions feel generic** — MBTI or fortune companions lack personality/warmth | Medium     | High — destroys emotional connection | Extensive personality design, user feedback loops, start with well-crafted companions                           |
| **Low retention** — Users try once and don't return                              | High       | High — no growth                     | Regular new companions, daily fortune feature, social engagement hooks, build emotional attachment              |
| **Platform competition** — ChatGPT adds "personality test mode"                  | Medium     | Critical — existential               | Move fast, build brand/community, focus on companion personality and emotional connection they won't prioritize |

**Biggest unknown:** Will users share Artifacts publicly? The social layer depends on users being willing to post results. Early testing needed.

**Note on terminology:** We avoid overusing "AI" in marketing — the focus is on the experience (chat, fun, beautiful results), not the technology.

### Q: What's the business model?

**A:** Phased approach:

**v1: Free Trial → BYOK or Credits**

| Stage                 | What happens                                              |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Free trial**        | First 1-2 agents completely free (we cover LLM costs)     |
| **Limit reached**     | User is blocked from further interaction                  |
| **Conversion prompt** | Two options presented: BYOK (free forever) or Buy Credits |

| Revenue stream | Description                                                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **BYOK**       | Users bring their own API key — free for us, ~$0.01-0.05 per session for them |
| **Credits**    | Purchase credits (~$1 for 20 sessions) — margin on top of API costs           |

**Why this model:**

- Zero friction to try — no signup, no payment, no API key setup
- Users experience the product before any conversion ask
- BYOK users cost us nothing and become power users
- Credit purchases fund the free trial pool

**v2: Premium Agents (Future)**

- Some agents could be premium-only
- Early access to new agents
- Subscription tier for unlimited access

**v3: B2B / White-label (Future)**

- "Kiwizard for Team Building" — corporate personality assessments
- API access for other apps to embed agents

**Key principle:** No ads, no data selling. Revenue comes from users who find value.

### Q: How do we measure success?

**A:**

**Primary metrics:**

| Metric              | Definition                                                  | Target (Month 3) |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Completion rate** | % of users who start a conversation AND receive an Artifact | >60%             |
| **Conversion rate** | % of users who hit limit AND choose BYOK or Credits         | >20%             |
| **Share rate**      | % of Artifacts that get shared to Feed                      | >15%             |
| **Return rate**     | % of users who come back within 7 days                      | >25%             |
| **NPS**             | Net Promoter Score                                          | >40              |

**Secondary metrics:**

- Sessions per user per week
- Time spent in chat (engagement)
- Agents tried per user
- Feed scroll depth

**Anti-metric:**

- We do NOT optimize for "sessions per user" alone — quality matters more than quantity

---

### Q: What does Year 1 success look like?

**A:**

**By end of Year 1:**

- 100,000 total users (web + mobile combined)
- 20,000 monthly active users
- 10+ companions live
- iOS and Android apps launched
- Active community feed with daily posts
- Clear signal on willingness to pay (via credit purchases)
- Word-of-mouth growth visible
- Users forming emotional connections with favorite companions

**Qualitative success:**

- Artifacts get shared on Instagram/Twitter organically
- Community forms around comparing results and favorite companions
- Mobile app ratings 4.5+ stars
- Users return to chat with favorite companions regularly

---

### Q: What's the platform strategy?

**A:**

**Phase 1: Web first**

- Launch on web (React, responsive design)
- Works on mobile browsers from day one
- Faster to build, easier to iterate
- No app store approval delays

**Phase 2: Native mobile apps**

- iOS and Android using React Native
- Shared codebase with web where possible
- Timeline: 2-3 months after web launch
- Key mobile features: push notifications, native sharing, offline support

**Why web first:**

| Reason    | Explanation                                                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Speed     | Ship faster, get feedback faster                                                |
| Iteration | Update instantly without app store reviews                                      |
| SEO       | Personality tests are highly searchable — "MBTI test" gets millions of searches |
| Sharing   | Web links are easier to share than app deep links                               |
| Cost      | One codebase initially, expand to native later                                  |

**Tech stack:**

- Web: React (current codebase)
- Mobile: React Native (code sharing potential)
- Backend: Same API serves both platforms

---

### Q: What could kill this project?

**A:**

1. **Companions lack personality**
   - If companions feel generic or robotic, users won't connect emotionally
   - Mitigation: Heavy investment in personality design and prompt engineering, start narrow (2 companions), iterate based on feedback

2. **No social traction**
   - If users don't share to Feed, the social layer dies
   - Mitigation: Make Artifacts beautiful and shareable, add incentives for sharing, consider private-by-default option

3. **OpenAI/Google ships this feature**
   - If ChatGPT adds a dedicated "personality tests" mode with shareable results
   - Mitigation: Move fast, build brand, focus on community/social features they won't build

4. **User fatigue with conversational interfaces**
   - If chat-based experiences become tiresome
   - Mitigation: Focus on entertainment value and beautiful results, not the technology

---

### Q: How will we acquire early users?

**A:**

**Constraints:**

- Solo founder with limited time
- Budget: ~$50/day ($1,500/month)

**Strategy: Content + Paid acquisition**

| Channel                    | Budget/Day | Why                                                           |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **Reddit**                 | $25        | Target r/mbti, r/enneagram, r/astrology communities           |
| **Meta Ads**               | $25        | Target personality test interest groups                       |

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Seed users**

- Launch with MBTI + 사주
- Post results on personal social media
- Reach out to MBTI/personality content creators
- Goal: 1,000 users, understand what resonates

**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): Paid validation**

- Run $50/day ads testing different companions/angles
- A/B test: "AI companions for personality tests" vs "Chat with MBTI companion" vs "Meet your fortune companion"
- Goal: <$2 per user, identify winning creative

**Phase 3 (Month 3+): Scale what works**

- Double down on winning channels
- Launch new companions to drive return visits
- Leverage Feed content for organic growth

## Appendix: Fortune Telling Reference

A reference guide to popular fortune telling types that could inspire Kiwizard agents.

### 1. Horoscope / Astrology

**What it is:**
Uses the 12 zodiac signs (Aries–Pisces) based on birth date to give daily/weekly/monthly forecasts and love/career/money horoscopes.

**Short description:**
The most common Western-style fortune-telling, ranging from short "today's horoscope" blurbs to long monthly forecasts written by astrologers.

---

### 2. Natal Chart & Transit Reading

**What it is:**
Uses your exact birth date, time, and place to calculate a natal (birth) chart, then interprets personality, life themes, and current trends based on planetary transits.

**Short description:**
A much more personalized form of astrology than simple sun-sign horoscopes, often used as a deep dive into personality plus timing for love, career, and life events.

---

### 3. Tarot Reading

**What it is:**
Draws cards from a tarot deck and interprets their symbolic meaning to reflect your current situation, mindset, near future, and possible advice.

**Short description:**
Commonly used to gain insight or guidance about "what's going on right now" rather than fixed predictions; online versions offer both auto-draws and live readings with human readers.

---

**What it is:**
One-on-one sessions (chat/phone/video) with psychics, astrologers, tarot readers, or spiritual advisors to ask about love, work, money, or the future.

**Short description:**
Similar to an online "fortune-teller shop": platforms aggregate many readers, you browse profiles and reviews, then pay per minute or per session for personalized readings.

---

### 5. Numerology

**What it is:**
Uses your name and birth date to calculate numbers like your Life Path Number or Destiny Number, then interprets these as life themes and tendencies.

A number-based fortune system analogous to Western-style saju, focusing on life purpose, personality, and timing (e.g., personal year numbers) using simple calculations.
